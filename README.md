# Developer Portfolio

Hey guys/girls! Goni here. It has been a long year. Many experiences, learnings, a bit of frustations. But here I am, developing my own portfolio. This'll be the first beta version of it, one of many more to come. I'm not very convinced of the design (should taken a design system) but, as many aspects, it'll be polished in newer versions. Now, some information about the project.

# Version

# What I'm working on here

- New React hook: useContext.
- Git workflow: atomic commits, branchs, merging.
