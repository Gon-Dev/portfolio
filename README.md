# Lastest Version
v0.1.1: Hotfixes for mobile responsive design
Responsive was bruh-ken. At least in my phone (running Android 11 in a 360x800 resolution). 

# Previous Version
v0.1.0: alpha
Notes:
Hey guys/girls! Goni here. It has been a long year. Many experiences, learnings, a bit of frustations. But here I am, developing my own portfolio. This'll be the first beta version of it, one of many more to come. I'm not very convinced of the design (should taken a design system) but, as many aspects, it'll be polished in newer versions. Now, some information about the project.

# What I'm working on here
- React 18.2: Using functional components and hooks as useState, useContext, useEffect, useRef.
- CSS: No libraries. No frameworks. Less is more.
- Git and Github: Self-explanatory.
- Figma: Designed by me, trying to get a techy-like but formal vibes, with 90s notes. The idea is to show what could happen if Matrix (only the first movie) and TRON had a succesful child. Well, you get the point. I hope. The color palette will expand in next releases to flow into more contrast, darker greys and more vibrant colors.
- EmailJS: Only one library in this project, for managing contact section's email sending to my personal gmail account.
